# Gesture-Controlled-Spotify-Player-using-Computer-Vision
Control Spotify playback using hand gestures in real time. This project uses MediaPipe hand landmark detection and OpenCV to build a gesture-based human–computer interaction system with smooth volume control, track navigation, and play/pause gestures via application-level automation.
